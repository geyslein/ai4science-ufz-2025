## Case Study "Lisa"

11-year-old Lisa suffers from a washing compulsion. She is constantly worried about getting her hands dirty and avoids—as much as possible—contact with other people and objects that other people have touched (e.g., cash). She doesn't shake hands with anyone and only touches door handles with her elbow at most. After unavoidable hand contact and after using the toilet, she washes her hands excessively for at least ten minutes. She uses a large amount of liquid soap for this. Accordingly, the skin on her hands is reddened and dried out. Additionally, she brushes her teeth excessively twice a day following a special ritual. She worries particularly in the evenings about possible contamination and catching diseases, which leads to sleep onset latencies of two hours. Not only is Lisa increasingly desperate about having to wash her hands so often. Her parents are also at a loss and burdened. The described symptoms were first noticed about six months ago and are steadily increasing in intensity. Already in early childhood, special rituals were noticed during toilet visits, and during kindergarten age she often had to reassure herself that her parents were still there. At times, she refused to attend kindergarten.

## Part 1:
Person A (therapist) creates an individual compulsion hierarchy together with Person B (Lisa). Subsequently, Lisa should be prepared for the upcoming exposure exercises (an explanation of the exposure rationale has already been provided beforehand).

## Part 2:
Switch your roles and agree together on a suitable situation for the first exposure. Person A (Lisa) is guided through the exposure by Person B (therapist). Find a good conclusion to the exercise afterwards. What happens next?
