# Text Generation

In this exercise, we want to generate a speech. A sample prompt is available in [this document](./speech-prompt.docx). Once a first speech has been generated, generate a second one. Modify:
* Framework of the speech (Internal senate meeting instead of public speech)
* Target audience (for example professors instead of students and journalists)
* Length of the speech
* Content details

Note: Limit the time you spend on this. Other exciting exercises will follow.
